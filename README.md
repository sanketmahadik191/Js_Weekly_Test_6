- Create a function to display books based on their categories.

### Add to Cart:

- Implement a shopping cart object to keep track of selected items.
- Add buttons to allow users to add items to their cart.
- Update the cart's UI to show selected items and their quantities.
- Calculate the total price of items in the cart.

### User Sign-In/Sign-Up:

- Create forms for user registration and login.
- Validate user input for registration and login.
- Implement user authentication (you may use a backend service or framework for this).
- Store user data securely, such as email and password (hashed).


### User Profile:

- Create a user profile page where users can view and edit their account information.


### Data Storage:

- Use a backend server to store user data, book information, and cart data.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and user profiles.
- Connect your frontend to the backend server using API calls (e.g., with fetch or axios).
